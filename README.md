# QR-It(Food Delivery Website)

The Food Ordering Website for Employees is a web application designed to streamline the process of ordering food for employees within an organization. The application allows employees to view the daily menu, place orders, make payments, and receive a QR code for their orders. Canteen workers can then scan these QR codes to access order details.
