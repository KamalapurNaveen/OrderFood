# Food Ordering Website for Employees

## Project Overview

The Food Ordering Website for Employees is a web application designed to streamline the process of ordering food for employees within an organization. The application allows employees to view the daily menu, place orders, make payments, and receive a QR code for their orders. Canteen workers can then scan these QR codes to access order details.

## Features

1. **Menu Display:**
   - Employees can view the menu for the day with details on available dishes, prices, and descriptions.

2. **Order Placement:**
   - Users can select dishes from the menu and place orders for lunch.

3. **Payment Processing:**
   - Secure payment gateway integration for successful order transactions.

4. **QR Code Generation:**
   - After successful payment, users receive a unique QR code for their order.

5. **Order Management:**
   - Employees can view their order history and details.

6. **Canteen Worker Dashboard:**
   - Canteen workers have a dashboard to scan QR codes and access order information.
